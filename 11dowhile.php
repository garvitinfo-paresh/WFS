<!-- 2. Do-While Loop
The do-while loop is similar to a while loop except that it is guaranteed to execute at least once. After executing a part of a program for once, the rest of the code gets executed based on a given boolean condition. -->


<?php
$x =1;
do {
  echo "The number is: $x <br>";
  $x++;
} while ($x <= 9);
?>
