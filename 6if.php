<!-- PHP Conditional Statements
Conditional Statements are used to perform actions based on different conditions. Sometimes when we write a program, we want to perform some different actions for different actions. We can solve this by using conditional statements. 
In PHP we have these conditional statements:
if Statement.
if-else Statement
If-elseif-else Statement
Switch statement
1. if Statement
This statement executes the block of code inside the if statement if the expression is evaluated as True.  -->
<?php
$x = "18";
if ($x < "20") {
  echo "Hello World!";
}
?>
